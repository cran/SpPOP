\title{Generation of spatial population along with spatially varying model parameters generated based on linear function of latitudes and longitudes}
\usage{
SpPOP_linear1(N, k, xlat, ylong)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{integer; population size i.e. N= (k * k)}

\item{k}{integer}

\item{xlat}{numeric vector}

\item{ylong}{numeric vector}
}
\value{
The developed function returns a dataframe of spatially generated population consist of simulated response variable (i.e. Y) along with their spatial coordinates, spatially varying coefficients and one explanatory variable (i.e. X). The auxiliary variable
        has been generated following U(0,1) and the regression coefficients are generated as linear function of latitudes and longitudes.
